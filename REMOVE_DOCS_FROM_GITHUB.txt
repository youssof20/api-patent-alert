===========================================
REMOVE DOCS FOLDER FROM GITHUB
===========================================

✅ DONE:
- Removed entire docs/ folder from git tracking
- Added docs/ to .gitignore (will never be pushed again)
- All changes are staged and ready

🚀 RUN THESE COMMANDS TO REMOVE FROM GITHUB:

git commit -m "Remove docs folder from repository - keep local only"
git push origin main

That's it! The docs/ folder will be completely removed from GitHub.

===========================================
WHAT HAPPENS:
- docs/ folder disappears from GitHub
- All 14 files in docs/ are deleted from GitHub
- .gitignore updated to prevent future pushes
- Files stay on your local machine (not deleted)

===========================================
FUTURE PROTECTION:
The .gitignore now includes:
  docs/

So anything you put in docs/ will NEVER be pushed to GitHub.
